I will be presenting my Home Assignment 3 for Neural Networks and Deep Learning, covering autoencoders and RNNs. Letâ€™s go through the code execution.

---

*Q1: Basic Autoencoder*  
- Loaded the MNIST dataset and reshaped images.
- Built an encoder with 32 neurons and a decoder to reconstruct images.
- Trained the model using binary cross-entropy and visualized the results.
- Tested different latent space sizes (16, 64) to analyze reconstruction quality.

*Q2: Denoising Autoencoder*  
- Added Gaussian noise to images before training.
- The model learned to reconstruct clean images from noisy ones.
- Compared noisy vs. reconstructed images.
- Real-world use case: Noise removal in medical imaging.

*Q3: RNN for Text Generation*  
- Used an LSTM-based model to predict the next character in a text sequence.
- Tokenized text, created input sequences, and trained the model.
- Explained temperature scaling for controlling randomness in text generation.

*Q4: Sentiment Classification with LSTM*  
- Used the IMDB dataset for binary sentiment classification.
- Preprocessed text, trained an LSTM model, and evaluated results with a confusion matrix.
- Discussed the precision-recall tradeoff in sentiment analysis.

*Conclusion:*  
This assignment helped me understand autoencoders for image reconstruction and denoising, as well as RNNs for text generation and sentiment classification. Thank you for watching!
